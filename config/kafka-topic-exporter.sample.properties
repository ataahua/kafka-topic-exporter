## Kafka core properties

# A list of host/port pairs to use for establishing the initial connection to the Kafka cluster.
# The client will make use of all servers irrespective of which servers are specified here for bootstrapping
# this list only impacts the initial hosts used to discover the full set of servers. This list should be in
# the form <code>host1:port1,host2:port2,...</code>. Since these servers are just used for the initial
# connection to discover the full cluster membership (which may change dynamically), this list need not
# contain the full set of servers (you may want more than one, though, in case a server is down).
bootstrap.servers=localhost:9092

# A unique string that identifies the consumer group this consumer belongs to. This property is required if
# the consumer uses either the group management functionality by using <code>subscribe(topic)</code> or the
# Kafka-based offset management strategy.
# kte = kafka-topic-exporter
group.id=kte-group

# An id string to pass to the server when making requests. The purpose of this is to be able to track the
# source of requests beyond just ip/port by allowing a logical application name to be included in
# server-side request logging.
# kte = kafka-topic-exporter
client.id=kte
